I love you so much and I hope you get that locked up in that mind of yours. it's our first Valentine's day together baby and hey it's not so bad. we have each other baby. and I'll always love you no matter how angry or mad I am at you which is rn. so you better come talk. anyway yes when the distance is over Princesa, we'll get to spend everyday of our lives like it's valentine's day together and I promise you baby. I promise you I'll give you everything you ever want in life and everything I can offer cuz you are a queen darling and you deserve the absolute best. Happy Valentine's Day baby. MWAHH
